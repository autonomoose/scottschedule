## Reference

### Tlang statements
Statements must start with one of the following:
- begin - standard event scheduler
- option - specify any effects from options specified by user
- action - future use for event action
- actopt - future use

#### Compound statements
make compound statements using a comma to separate times
An example would be an event that occurs 3 times
begin 9:00,13:00,18:00

### Tlang times
- Zero padding (ie 08 instead of 8) is OK for any time.

#### Common Tlang times:
- h:m - basic time hour and minute,range 0:0 to 23:59
- m -  startHour:m as an exact number of minutes rather than an offset
- +h:m - offset hours and minutes from start
- +m - offset minutes from start
- timewords (now,...)

#### Special cases:
| time | descr | rule statements |
| --- | --------------- | ------------ |
| ++h:m | offset hours and minutes from last event | 'or', 'repeat' |
| h:m- | basic time hour and minute also matches all times sooner | 'start','repeat' |
| h:m+ | basic time hour and minute also matches all times later | 'start' |


#### Complex times

Using 'or':
- 'or' segments can be stacked, time returned is last check passed
- offset times(+h:m) also match later times (they are technically +h:m+)
- basic times(h:m) also match sooner times (they are technically h:m-)
- alternate basic and offset times to provide complex adjustments

An example would be event between 11-12am depending upon start time:
begin 11:00 or +3:00 or 12:00
- If started at 7:15, +3 hours = 10:15 (or later than 11:00-fail) would yield task at 11:00
- If started at 8:15, +3 hours = 11:15 (later-pass), 12:00 (or sooner than 11:15-fail) would yield task at 11:15
- If started at 9:15, +3 hours = 12:15 (later-pass), 12:00 (or sooner than 12:15-pass) would yield task at 12:00
The description of this would be:
 Event 3 hours after x but no sooner than 11:00am and no later than 12:00pm.
